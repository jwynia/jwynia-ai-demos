# README
This repo is my place for storing examples I use in demos for AI workshops, screencasts, etc.

To run the examples, you NEED to create an .env file in the root and add whatever of these keys you want to work in the various scripts and notebooks.
```
OPEN_API_KEY=sk_XXXXXXXXXXX
```

# Tools
How I work with these things is in VSCode. I use the Python and Jupyter notebooks plugins, but also the following additional plugins you'll likely see me use in demos/workshops:

* Rubberduck - https://github.com/rubberduck-ai/rubberduck-vscode
    This puts ChatGPT chat window directly into VSCode
* AI Genie - https://github.com/ai-genie/chatgpt-vscode
    This puts ChatGPT in VSCode in a slightly different way, including the ability to highlight code and ask for an explanation of what it does, find problems, optimize, etc.
